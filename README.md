## Overview

- [Quick Start](./docs/quick-start.md)

Load Balancer Operator for Kubernetes is a Cluster API speaking operator for load balancers. It manages the lifecycle of load balancers implementations and provides a cluster control plane high availability interface in the multi-cluster scenario.

## Features

1. It reconciles Cluster API objects and provisions Service type LoadBalancer for control plane Machines to achieve HA.
2. It leverages [Carvel Packaging APIs](https://carvel.dev/kapp-controller/docs/latest/packaging) to lifecycle manage load balancer provider operator. Currently, we now support VMware's [NSX Advanced Load Balancer Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/vmware/load-balancer-and-ingress-services-for-kubernetes) as a reference implementation.
3. It bridges [Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/) and load balancer provider operator to ensure load balancer resources are cleaned up when cluster is deleted.
4. For the NSX Advanced Load Balancer operator, it also automates the user account creation and injection per cluster.
